## Grading and Collaboration Policy

### Lab Assignments
All the three lab assignments must be completed to satisfaction (passed) in order to sit for the exam. Cooperating for assignments is tolerated only at the high level ideas but copying code is not allowed.

### Projects
The project accounts the 40 % of your grade. You will get a grade based on the novelty, quality and complexity of the project, along with the ability to show use of appropriate models, preprocessing techniques and evaluation strategies. The projects are done in groups of 2-4. 

### Plagiarism Warning  

Any form of cheating, plagiarism, i.e. copying of another student’s text or source code, will result in the grade F, and immediate disqualification from the course and may be reported to the university for administrative processing. Copying code from fellow students and borrowing code from past year also counts as cheating. You may collaborate ideas with your fellow students but do not copy the code. It is perfectly fine to get help from fellow students to debug something or get tips if you are stuck somewhere but copying code is forbidden. We will do plagiarism detection using a software which takes into account same with only minor changes to structure of the code, method names or variables. Committing acts that violate Student Conduct policies that result in course disruption are cause for suspension or dismissal from UiS. 

Don’t cheat. It’s not worth it!


## Git and GitHub

Git is a distributed revision control and source code management system.
Basic knowledge of Git is required for handing in the lab assignments.
There are many great resources available online for learning Git.
A good book is Pro Git, which is available for free [here](https://git-scm.com/book).
Chapter 2.1 and 2.2 should contain the necessary information for delivering the lab assignments.

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system.
An introduction to Git and GitHub is available in [this video](http://youtu.be/U8GBXvdmHT4).

You need to sign up for a GitHub account to get access to the needed course material.

## Group Signup

Projects will be done in groups. So this step is only needed once you are ready to work on your project.

1. Read the [policy about group assignments](policy.md#group-assignments).
   Find and agree with another student to form a group.
   We prefer groups of two, but will allow groups of three.
   It is important that all group members agree to contribute equally to the group assignments.

   If you prefer to work alone, you must still create a group.

2. Agree on a name for the group.
   The name will be used as the group's GitHub repository.
   We prefer group names that identifies the persons in the group.
   **The group name cannot be changed later.**

3. Navigate to the course's left menu bar and select “New Group”.

4. Enter the name of the group in the textbox above the list of students.

5. In the dialog, find your own name via the “Search for students” text box.
   Click the Plus (+) symbol to add yourself to the group.

6. Repeat the above step for the other group members.

7. Click the “Create” button.
