# Labs

## Autograder

This course uses Autograder, a tool developed at the University of Stavanger
for students and teaching staff to manage the submission and validation of
lab assignments. All lab submissions from students are handled using Git,
a source code management system, and GitHub, a web-based hosting service for
Git source repositories. Thus, basic knowledge of these tools are necessary.

Students push their updated lab submissions to GitHub. Every lab submission is
then processed by a custom continuous integration tool. This tool will run
several test cases on the submitted code. Autograder generates feedback that
let the students verify if their submission implements the required functionality.
This feedback is available through a web interface. The feedback from the
Autograder system can be used by students to improve their submissions.

## Grading and Collaboration Policy

### Lab Assignments
All the three lab assignments must be completed to satisfaction (passed) in order to sit for the exam. Cooperating for assignments is tolerated only at the high level ideas but copying code is not allowed.

### Projects
The project accounts the 40 % of your grade. You will get a grade based on the novelty, quality and complexity of the project, along with the ability to show use of appropriate models, preprocessing techniques and evaluation strategies. The projects are done in groups of 2-4. 

### Plagiarism Warning  

Any form of cheating, plagiarism, i.e. copying of another student’s text or source code, will result in the grade F, and immediate disqualification from the course and may be reported to the university for administrative processing. Copying code from fellow students and borrowing code from past year also counts as cheating. You may collaborate ideas with your fellow students but do not copy the code. It is perfectly fine to get help from fellow students to debug something or get tips if you are stuck somewhere but copying code is forbidden. We will do plagiarism detection using a software which takes into account same with only minor changes to structure of the code, method names or variables. Committing acts that violate Student Conduct policies that result in course disruption are cause for suspension or dismissal from UiS. 

Don’t cheat. It’s not worth it!


## Git and GitHub

Git is a distributed revision control and source code management system.
Basic knowledge of Git is required for handing in the lab assignments.
There are many great resources available online for learning Git.
A good book is Pro Git, which is available for free [here](https://git-scm.com/book).
Chapter 2.1 and 2.2 should contain the necessary information for delivering the lab assignments.

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system.
An introduction to Git and GitHub is available in [this video](http://youtu.be/U8GBXvdmHT4).

You need to sign up for a GitHub account to get access to the needed course material.

## Autograder Registration

Follow the steps below to register and sign up for the course on Autograder.
Here are two short videos recorded by Prof. Hein Meling (inventor of Autograder) describing these steps in the context of a different course DAT320 (same steps should work with DAT550): [Part 1](https://youtu.be/3KJm4ABvTAo) and [Part 2](https://youtu.be/kMyH_-8xMGc).

1. Go to [GitHub](http://github.com) and register.
   A GitHub account is required to sign in to Autograder.
   You can skip this step if you already have an account.

2. Click the "Sign in with GitHub" button in [Autograder](http://uis.itest.run) to register.
   You will then be taken to GitHub's website.

3. Approve that our Autograder application may have permission to access to the requested parts of your account.
   It is possible to make a separate GitHub account for only this (and other) courses if you do not want Autograder to access your personal one with the requested permissions.

## Signing up for the Course on Autograder

1. Click the Plus (+) menu and select “Join course”. Available courses will be listed.

2. Find the course and click Enroll.

3. Wait for the teaching staff to confirm your Autograder registration.

4. You will then be invited to the course organization on GitHub and two separate repositories.
   You will need to navigate to each of these links and accept these invitations:

   - Navigate to the course organization [dat550-2022](https://github.com/dat550-2022) accept the invitation.
   - Navigate to the [assignments](https://github.com/dat550-2022/assignments) repository and accept the invitation.
   - Navigate to your private <https://github.com/dat550-2022/username-labs> repository and accept the invitation. Remember to replace `username` in this link with your own GitHub `username`.

   Several invitation emails will also be sent to the email address associated with your GitHub account.
   However, emails from GitHub can sometimes take a while to arrive.

5. Once you have accepted the invitations, you will get your own repository under `dat550-2022`, which is the course's organization on GitHub.

## Submitting the assignment once it is working
The procedure used to submit your lab assignments is explained in the [lab submission process](lab-submission.md).

## Group Signup on Autograder

Projects will be done in groups. So this step is only needed once you are ready to work on your project.

1. Read the [policy about group assignments](policy.md#group-assignments).
   Find and agree with another student to form a group.
   We prefer groups of two, but will allow groups of three.
   It is important that all group members agree to contribute equally to the group assignments.

   If you prefer to work alone, you must still create a group.

2. Agree on a name for the group.
   The name will be used as the group's GitHub repository.
   We prefer group names that identifies the persons in the group.
   **The group name cannot be changed later.**

3. Navigate to the course's left menu bar and select “New Group”.

4. Enter the name of the group in the textbox above the list of students.

5. In the dialog, find your own name via the “Search for students” text box.
   Click the Plus (+) symbol to add yourself to the group.

6. Repeat the above step for the other group members.

7. Click the “Create” button.
